# On MagicMirror Pi
# Open a terminal
# mkdir GoogleHomeDoorbell in a dir of your choice
# cd to GoogleHomeDoorbell
# Run the below

gpio -v
gpio readall
# This should export a list of GPIO pins on your Pi

# On a Raspberry Pi 4 I had to issue these commands to make it work correctly:
cd /tmp
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb

# Then do this again:
gpio -v
gpio readall

# Install 433Utils:
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils.git cd 433Utils/RPi_utils
cd 433Utils/RPi_utils
mv RFSniffer.cpp oldRFSniffer.cpp
wget http://www.securipi.co.uk/433.zip tar xvf 433.zip
tar xvf 433.zip
chmod a+x *.sh
make
ls -al

sudo ./test.sh

# Now press your doorbell and this should capture its RF frequency ID Number if the doorbell is compatable. (USE THE ONE I SUGGEST IN REPO)
